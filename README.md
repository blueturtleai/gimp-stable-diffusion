# gimp-stable-diffusion
This repository includes a GIMP plugin, which can be used for generating images with stable-diffusion:

### Stablehorde
This plugin can be used without running a stable-diffusion server yourself. It uses [Stablehorde](https://stablehorde.net) as the backend. Stablehorde is a cluster of stable-diffusion servers run by volunteers. [Check it out](https://github.com/blueturtleai/gimp-stable-diffusion/tree/main/stablehorde).
